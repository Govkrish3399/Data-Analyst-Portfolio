**Personal Projects**

 **Project 1**: Credit Risk Assessment Analysis
 
 Code: [EDA_CREDIT_RISK_ANALYSIS_GOVIND.ipynb](https://github.com/Govkrish3399/CREDIT-RISK-ASSESSMENT-ANALYSIS/blob/main/EDA_CREDIT_RISK_ANALYSIS_GOVIND.ipynb)

The project include following steps like data loading, data cleaning and preproccessing, EDA( Exploratory Data Analysis), correlation analysis.

Skills: Data cleaning,Data analysis,Correlation analysis, Data visualization.
