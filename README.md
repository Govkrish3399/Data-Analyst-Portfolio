**Personal Projects**

 **Project 1**: Forecasting Car Prices in Belarus
 
 Code: [Car_Price_Prediction_of_Belarus.ipynb](https://github.com/Govkrish3399/Forecasting-Car-Prices-in-Belarus/blob/main/Car_Price_Prediction_of_Belarus.ipynb)
 
 Goal : To understand important features impacting car price.

 Description: The object of this project is to predict/forecast the car prices in Belarus, by analyzing car features like brand, engine, fuel type, segment, transmisson, mileage, drive unit, color.

The feature Description:

Brand: The car manufacturer.

Engine: Engine specifications.

Fuel Type: Whether the car runs on gasoline, diesel, electric, or hybrid.

Segment: Car segment.

Transmission: Manual or automatic transmission.

Mileage: Total distance the car has traveled.

Drive Unit: Front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. Color: Exterior color of the car.

The dataset consist of 57,000 rows and 12 columns

Skills: Data cleaning,EDA,Correlation analysis, Data Modelling, Data visualization.

Tech stack: Python

Results: The objective of this project was to forecast car prices in Belarus by examining features such as brand, year, engine, fuel type, transmission, mileage, drive unit, color, and segment. Exploratory data analysis revealed a marked increase in car prices in Belarus post-2000. Petrol cars with automatic transmissions are priced higher than diesel cars with manual transmissions. Electric cars, however, are notably more expensive than other types. Among drive units, all-wheel-drive vehicles command the highest prices. In terms of segments, specialty cars top the list, followed by luxury European, American, and Asian car segments.
A decision tree classifier model was employed to predict car prices, achieving a 97% accuracy rate. The mileage, color are the most important features for predicting car price, followed by year and volume.

**Project 2**: Covid 19 data exploration

Code: [SQLCovid19.sql](https://github.com/Govkrish3399/Exploring-Covid-19-data-set-using-SQL-server-management-studio)

Description: The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

Skills: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Tech stack: SQL Server.
